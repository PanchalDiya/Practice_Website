      <p class="srctionSubtag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits and
        comes in many forms. Formal education happens in a complex institutional framework, like public schools.
        Non-formal education is also structured but takes place outside the formal schooling system, while informal
        education is unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal education are divided into
        levels that include early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education.
        Other classifications focus on the teaching method, like teacher-centered and student-centered education, and on
        the subject, like science education, language education, and physical education. The term "education" can also
        refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people and the academic field studying educational
        phenomena.</p>

      <p class="srctionSubtag text-small">The precise definition of education is disputed, and there are disagreements
        about what the aims of education are and to what extent education is different from indoctrination by fostering
        critical thinking. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education.
        Fundamentally, education socializes children into society by teaching cultural values and norms. It equips them
        with the skills needed to become productive members of society. This way, it stimulates economic growth and
        raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized institutions affect many aspects of education. For
        example, governments set education policies to determine when school classes happen, what is taught, and who can
        or must attend. International organizations, like UNESCO, have been influential in promoting primary education
        for all children.Many factors influence whether education is successful. Psychological factors include
        motivation, intelligence, and personality. Social factors, like socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender, are
        often linked to discrimination. Further factors include access to educational technology, teacher quality, and
        parent involvement.</p>

      <p class="srctionSubtag text-small">In prehistory, education happened informally through oral communication and
        imitation. With the rise of ancient civilizations, writing was invented, and the amount of knowledge grew. This
        caused a shift from informal to formal education. Initially, formal education was mainly available to elites and
        religious groups. The invention of the printing press in the 15th century made books more widely available. This
        increased general literacy. Beginning in the 18th and 19th centuries, public education became more important.
        This development led to the worldwide process of making primary education available to all, free of charge, and
        compulsory up to a certain age. Today, over 90% of all primary-school-age children worldwide attend primary
